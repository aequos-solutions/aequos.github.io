# Installation

!!! info "Trial version"
    If you don't have a valid license when using one of the Web Parts for the first time in a page, **a 14 days trial period will automatically begin associated to your Microsoft 365 tenant ID**. You don't need to provide any credit card or personal information, simply follow the steps below to start using the solution. At the end of the trial period, a license validation message will appear preventing using the Web Parts anymore. To continue to use them, you must purchase a valid license.

    Trial periods are not cumulative. However, if you need more time to complete your evaluation simply contact us directly at [mdv@sword-group.com](mailto:mdv@sword-group.com).

    > * The solution is deployed in the general Micraosoft 365 CDN meaning **we don't host any code on our side**.

    > * You can choose to make the solution available in [all sites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/tenant-scoped-deployment) or force to install an app to the site every time.
